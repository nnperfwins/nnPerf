nnPerf is a real-time on-device profiler designed to collect and analyze the DNN model runtime inference latency on mobile platforms. nnPerf demystifies the hidden layers and metrics used for pursuing DNN optimizations and adaptations at the granularity of operators and kernels, ensuring every facet contributing to a DNN model's runtime efficiency is easily accessible to mobile developers via well-defined APIs.
With nnPerf, the mobile developers can easily identify the bottleneck in model run-time efficiency and optimize the model architecture to meet system-level objectives (SLO).
For more design details, please refer to our Sensys 2023 paper.

## To Install / Run profile

### Quick start with apk

It is recommended to run nnPerf on system versions below Android 12.

1. Download nnPerf_v1.1.apk from the release version.

2. Use adb to connect to smartphones or mobile platforms (Android basic system).

3. Install the nnPerf_v1.1.apk.

	```shell
	adb install -t '.\nnPerfAPKinstaller\nnPerf_v1.0.apk'
	```

### Build project

1. Install Android Studio 3.6.3 (Runtime version: 1.8.0_212-release-1586-b04 amd64)

2. Import Project

	File -> Open -> Current file directory 

3. Android Studio Setting

```shell
	Android Gradle Plugin Version: 3.1.3

	Gradle Version:                4.4

	NDK Version:                   21.0.6113669

	JDK Verison:                   1.8.0_211

	Complile Sdk Version:          27

	Build Tools Version:           27.0.3

```

4. Run to profile

```shell
	Update Output path: /data/data/com.example.android.nnPerf/
```

5. Note: In the case of GPU reasoning, do not directly switch models.

6. Model support list (Support for adding other .tflite models)
